            <p>The feeling of spiciness comes from a chemical called capsaicin, which releases as a fine spray when you
                bit into food that contains it.</p>
            <p>It latches onto and triggers your heat receptors, making your nervous system think that you are
                overheating. That, is the spiciness we feel. </p>

            <p>Pepper plants have evolved to have a chemical known as capsaicin, which deters mammals from eating it.
            </p>
            <p>This is because mammals have molars, which grind and destroy seeds, preventing them from germinating and
                growing into more pepper plants.</p>
            <p>Birds, which are not affected by capsaicin, will be able to spread more seeds from the pepper plants,
                resulting in more of these plants growing.</p>

        <section class="page" id="page3">
            <p>The scoville scale is the measurement of spiciness in chili peppers and other substances. The unit of
                measurement used for it is Scoville heat units.</p>
            <p>It was created by the American pharmacist Wilbur Scoville, and is a subjective assessment based on the
                sensitivity of people who are experienced in eating hot chilis.</p>

        <section class="page" id="page4">
            <p>When you want to wash away the spiciness, usually you would drink water, or milk.</p>
            <p>If you have done this before, you would have noticed that milk does the job much easier than water.</p>
            <p>This is because capsaicin is hydrophobic, which means it repels water, so water cannot easily wash away
                capsaicin and get rid of the pain.</p>
            <p>Milk contains fat, which can dissolve the fat soluble capsaicin, and casein.</p>
            <p>Casein is a protein which helps to break down the bonds capsaicin forms on your nerve receptors, and help
                wash the spiciness away.</p>

            <p>So capsaicin is an irritant. Why do many people still like consuming it?</p>
